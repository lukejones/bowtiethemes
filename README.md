Bowtie themes
=============

Themes I've created for the free and fantastic OS X application [Bowtie](http://www.bowtieapp.com/).

Themes
-------------

* ImportantBits v1.1 – [Download](https://github.com/downloads/lukejonesme/bowtiethemes/ImportantBits.bowtie.tar.gz)
* Mini v1.0 – [Download](https://github.com/downloads/lukejonesme/bowtiethemes/Mini.bowtie.tar.gz)

Installation
-------------

To install any Bowtie theme, just double-click the .bowtie file you get when you clone the repository or [download](https://github.com/lukejonesme/bowtiethemes/downloads).

License
-------------

I don't know anything about licensing, so I'll just write it how I would say it in real-life: you can do whatever the hell you want with this source code, as long as they adhere to any licensing restrictions that Bowtie imposes on it's theme developers.

If you make any improvements, it'd be great if you could [send me a tweet](http://twitter.com/lukejonesme) or open a pull request to get your better version merged into the master branch.
